Free and Go accounts get **ChatGPT Web — Luna** in Codex's native model picker. Accounts that
expose the reasoning selector keep **Instant**, **Medium**, **High**, **Extra High**, and **Pro** as
their subscription allows. The bridge sends the current compiled Codex task context to a fresh
ChatGPT Temporary Chat, attaches images, and streams visible reasoning, tool activity, and Markdown
back into the same Codex task.

Codex task ──Responses + SSE──▶ codex-chatgpt-web ──embedded browser──▶ ChatGPT
     ▲                                │                                      │

```

Codex keeps the native task, context lifecycle, UI, and tool harness. The local Responses bridge
routes only the selected model turn through a fresh ChatGPT Temporary Chat; in full mode, MCP
connects ChatGPT back to the tools of that same Codex task.

## Highlights

- **A polished cross-platform launcher.** One command installs the native macOS, Windows, or Linux
  app. It keeps sign-in orchestration, setup, smoke testing, MCP guidance, runtime health, and local
  logs in one place, while the embedded browser lets you watch every ChatGPT turn as it happens. Up
  to five task-bound browser tabs can run in parallel; the cap avoids excessive parallel account
  traffic.
- **ChatGPT is the selected model.** It runs as a native Codex model, not as a tool called by
  another host model. The original model picker, task lifecycle, streaming, tracing, and tool UI
  remain intact.
- **Local-first task sessions.** Codex remains the source of truth for task history on your
  computer. Every browser turn starts in a fresh ChatGPT Temporary Chat and receives the current
  compiled context. Measured browser ceilings trigger compaction, while Luna carries completed
  state through an adaptive rolling checkpoint. Browser chats are never reused across tasks or
  added to normal ChatGPT history.
- **The full Codex harness over MCP.** In full mode, Instant through Extra High can use the active
  Codex task's filesystem, shell, images, approvals, and configured tools/apps through MCP. Calls
  and real results stay inside the same browser response—nothing is simulated as text.
- **Pro stays useful.** Pro is the one exception: ChatGPT's current Pro mode does not expose the
  custom MCP connector this bridge needs. Its native capabilities, including web search and
  research, remain available. Gather local workspace context with Instant through Extra High,
  switch to Pro, and Pro receives the current compiled Codex context for deeper analysis, subject
  to the same measured browser ceiling and compaction rules.
- **Fail-closed and manually tested.** Model selection, long inline context, images, streaming,
  visible trace, compaction, native tool rounds, cancellation, and Pro were exercised end-to-end on
  macOS and Windows 11. UI drift and missing capabilities produce explicit errors rather than
  silent fallbacks.

Temporary Chat is a ChatGPT privacy mode, not anonymity or local-only inference: prompts are still
processed by OpenAI and are subject to the account's settings and OpenAI's
[Temporary Chat policy](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq). This project
is unofficial; users remain responsible for complying with applicable OpenAI terms and workspace
policies.

## Quick start

Install or update the desktop launcher. To update or repair an existing installation, quit the
launcher and run the same command again; it replaces the application and embedded runtime while
preserving the ChatGPT profile and launcher configuration.

**macOS or Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.sh | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.ps1 | iex
```

Then complete the three checks in the app:

1. Sign in directly in the launcher's embedded ChatGPT browser. Login pages and identity-provider
   windows stay inside the same launcher-owned private browser profile; no session is copied between
   browsers.
2. Run the browser smoke test.
3. Press **Install models**, restart Codex once, and select a **ChatGPT Web — …** model.

The launcher detects the current account's ChatGPT controls during setup: Free/Go accounts expose
only Luna, while Pro appears only when the signed-in account exposes it. The separate **MCP** page
is optional and guides the full-harness setup without terminal commands.

The packaged launcher keeps sign-in and ChatGPT model turns in its embedded browser. It needs no
model API key, installed Chrome/Chromium, system Node/Bun, or project-managed browser download.

**Run from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web.git && \
cd codex-chatgpt-web && \
bun run app
```

This source path requires Bun 1.3.14. The command installs locked dependencies and opens the app.

## Modes

| Mode | Models | Local Codex tools | Extra setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser-only** | Free/Go: Luna; Plus: Instant–High; Pro: adds Extra High and Pro | No; Codex shows a warning | None |
| **Full harness** | Free/Go: Luna; Plus: Instant–High; Pro: adds Extra High and Pro | Non-Pro models: yes when the connector is available; Pro: read-only | OpenAI tunnel + ChatGPT connector |

Every picker entry has one fixed ChatGPT mode. Codex still displays its built-in Effort and Speed
rows, but changing them cannot silently change the selected browser model. Pro receives the current
compiled context from Codex, but ChatGPT Pro cannot initiate local MCP/tool calls.

## Full harness

Full mode connects ChatGPT's tool calls back to the current Codex task through the official
[OpenAI tunnel-client](https://github.com/openai/tunnel-client). The tunnel is outbound: it does
not expose a public IP, open an inbound port, or require router forwarding.

> [!WARNING]
> Create a **new** connector named **Codex Native2** and set its permissions to
> **Allow all actions**. Do not rename, refresh, or reuse an older **Codex Native** connector:
> ChatGPT caches the public MCP contract by connector identity, and **Allow low-risk actions**
> blocks commands and patches before they reach the Codex harness.

1. Finish the required launcher setup.
2. Open **MCP** in the launcher. Create the Tunnel and a regular API key on the same OpenAI account
   that will use the ChatGPT connector; creating the key is free and does not consume model API
   credits.
3. Paste the Tunnel ID and API key, then press **Connect harness**.
4. Enable **Developer Mode** in ChatGPT settings. Create a **new** connector using **Tunnel**, select
   that exact Tunnel, set **Authentication** to **None**, and name it exactly **Codex Native2**.
5. If an older **Codex Native** connector exists, leave it untouched. Do not rename or refresh it:
   ChatGPT caches the public MCP contract by connector identity, and this release uses a new direct
   turn-token contract. Under **Permissions** on **Codex Native2**, choose **Allow all actions**;
   **Allow low-risk actions** blocks commands and patches before they reach this runtime. The outer
   Codex harness still enforces its sandbox and approvals.
6. Run **Verify runtime**. It selects **Codex Native2** exactly. If only **Codex Native** is found,
   verification fails with an explicit migration error instead of accepting the legacy connector.

Write/modify actions also require the ChatGPT workspace and its administrator policy to permit
them. See
[developer mode and MCP apps](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-mcp-apps-in-chatgpt).
Unexpected approval prompts fail closed unless `--auto-approve-tool-calls` is explicitly enabled;
that option clicks **Allow once**, never a permanent grant.

## Operations

Use **Activity** for structured local logs and **Settings → Run doctor** for end-to-end health
checks. Use **Settings → Cancel retained browser turn** if a stopped task leaves ChatGPT working,
and **Settings → Remove Codex integration** before deleting the launcher so the previous Codex
route is restored.

Browser turn diagnostics save bounded JSON state at each checkpoint. Screenshots are captured for
stalled and failed turns, where the visible UI is needed to diagnose DOM drift without slowing every
successful step. Set `CODEX_CHATGPT_WEB_BROWSER_DIAGNOSTICS=1` before starting the runtime to also
capture a screenshot at every checkpoint during an investigation.

## Limitations and security

- This is unofficial browser automation, not an OpenAI API. ChatGPT UI changes can break selectors;
  drift fails explicitly instead of silently switching model or transport.
- ChatGPT's account-specific composer ceilings are smaller than some underlying model windows.
  The measured boundaries and requirements for a larger deterministic transport are tracked in
  [#76](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/issues/76).
- Browser state is a sensitive login artifact, and the loopback listener is reachable by processes
  running as the same local user. Never share the launcher profile; use a trusted workstation.
- Release packages currently target macOS 13+ (arm64/x64), Windows x64, and Linux x64. The browser
  flow is manually exercised end-to-end on macOS and Windows 11; runtime, tests, and native
  packaging are gated on all three operating systems in CI.
- Until platform signing credentials are configured for a release, macOS Gatekeeper or Windows
  SmartScreen may show an unknown-publisher warning. The one-command installers verify the
  published SHA-256 manifest before installation.
